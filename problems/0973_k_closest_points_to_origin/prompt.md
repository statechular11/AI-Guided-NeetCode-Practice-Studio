# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/

## Study Lists

- NeetCode 150; order 62; section: Heap / Priority Queue

## Problem Description

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., √(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

## Signature

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
```

## Input / Output Contract

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| points | integer[][] |
| k | integer |

Return type: `integer[][]`

## Examples

### Example 1

Input:

```text
points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
```

Output:

```text
[[-2,2]]
```

Explanation:

```text
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].
```

### Example 2

Input:

```text
points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
```

Output:

```text
[[3,3],[-2,4]]
```

Explanation:

The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.

## Constraints

- 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
- -10^4 <= xi, yi <= 10^4
