## Problem Description

In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to n, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array edges of length n where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of n nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

## Signature

```python
class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
```

## Input / Output Contract

| Parameter | Type |
| --- | --- |
| edges | integer[][] |

Return type: `integer[]`

## Examples

### Example 1

Input:

```text
edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
```

Output:

```text
[2,3]
```

### Example 2

Input:

```text
edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,4],[1,5]]
```

Output:

```text
[1,4]
```

## Constraints

- n == edges.length
- 3 <= n <= 1000
- edges[i].length == 2
- 1 <= ai < bi <= edges.length
- ai != bi
- There are no repeated edges.
- The given graph is connected.
